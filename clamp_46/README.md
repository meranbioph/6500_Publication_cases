CLAMP_46: Getting the baseline model, plus DF x 1/25

Based on clamp_43 (early time period of 2011)

Mesh: 1.5 x super coarse mesh on x and y (6123 cells)
OpenFOAM version: 9
Solver: clampPimpleFoam v6 and pimpleFoam

DF are modified. Qr is the original values.
D = 101 699 / 25 = 4067.96
F = 367 / 25 = 14.68
Qr = 45.650/(1+e^(-0.145+(T-283)))
