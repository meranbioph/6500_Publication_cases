CLAMP_44: D-F x 1/5

Based on clamp_43 (early time period of 2011, baseline model)

Mesh: 1.5 x super coarse mesh on x and y (6123 cells)
OpenFOAM version: 9
Solver: clampPimpleFoam v6 and pimpleFoam

D-F and Qr are the original values.
D = 101 700 / 5 = 20339.8
F = 367 / 5 = 73.4
Qr = 45.650/(1+e^(-0.145+(T-283)))
